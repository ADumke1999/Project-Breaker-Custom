# Project-Breaker-Custom
My iteration of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYG8UExRkhA&amp;t=1081s for my internship assignment with Purdue Global

The link shows the tutorial that I used to construct this. The things that I used were the bricks and code

I have replaced and will continue to replace many of the sprites and codes. The background, ball, and paddle are mine that I have designed via GIMP. 
The code has been edited to add functions such as pausing and a menu feature.
